# The reason I made this 🎟
After getting selected for [TKS](https://tks.world/) I was offered the opportunity to get a full-ride scholarship. As part of the challenge, I had to do a project within 14 days; so, I used my programming skills to get to work. After tossing and turning between several projects from making an art gallery using VR to developing a health-tracking app, I finally landed on this project; as my previous projects would have taken longer than 14 days to create.
